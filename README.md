## This is my personal website based on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and  [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/). 

### I'm now working on DL and RL based problem solving tasks in [ITS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITS). 

My research intersets lie in [Connected and Autonomous Vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_car) and [Intelligent Vehicle Infrastructure Cooperative System](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%99%BA%E8%83%BD%E8%BD%A6%E8%B7%AF%E5%8D%8F%E5%90%8C%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F/15876181?fr=aladdin). My current focus is to explore efficient and robust control methods for connected and autonomous vehicle in various heterougeneous traffic situations.


I will keep updating my research on this site, if anyone has the same interests please contact me.
Questions and Co-works are also very welcome! :D
