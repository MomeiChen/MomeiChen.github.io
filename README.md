# Xuan's personal website

## This is my personal website based on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and  [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/). 

### I'm now working on DL, RL based problem and high performance computing

My research intersets lie in GPU based traffic operation simulation and [Urban Air Mobility](https://www.faa.gov/uas/advanced_operations/urban_air_mobility). My current focus is to build a solid metropolitan scale parallel traffic operation simulator and explore efficient and robust control methods for UAM vehicles in various heterougeneous traffic situations.




I will keep updating my research on this site, if anyone has the same interests please contact me.
Questions and Co-works are also very welcome! :D
